# Angular Event Registration â€” Demo Application for Angular JS

This is my version of the PluralSight AngularJS Fundamentals application. It is for my own benefit to learn and become more familiar with AngularJS.

### Server

In this demonstration, the backend of the website is a Node Web Server. I have been using the command 'bash server.bat' to start the server.
### Running the application

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the app running in your browser.
